# Portfolio-website

This website is everything and literally *EVERYTHING* that you need to know about me.

So if you are willing to spend a long time reading things about me, then what are you waiting for? Have a nice read, learn more things about me and maybe we can keep in touch sometime.

## Navigation
This portfolio is made up of multiple sections, but these are the most important ones:

- Home section: Beginning of the page with my beautiful face put in (implemented soon...)
- About me section: Every relevant information that I can dish out to you. (Mostly about my personal life) you can also read about my current updates about my coding journey if you are one of the recruiters that I redirected to this repository.
**NOTICE**: This will be probably be outdated since I'm still learning more things about coding, so you might want to regularly check this portfolio on things that I learned
- Projects section: All of the projects that I built from scratch (IE this portfolio website). This section should give you an idea of what kind of programmer I'm. If you happend to see nothing but lorem ipsum text, that means that I either haven't updated it or I suck at programming.
- Contact section: This is the point where if you want to contact me or something similar, I have all my social media accounts linked in this section. This includes my LinkedIn, Github, Discord and (Twitter will be implemented soon).

You can also see the navigation bar at the top. Once you click on it, you should go to the section of the website that you want to maybe read through.
